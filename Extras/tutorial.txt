Welcome to the Faceoff tournament! 

I know the flight up here to space was long, but well worth it! The trading card battles are about to start! There's a whole tournament of people battling one another to get that first place trophy and to collect all the rare cards! We have already entered your information into the tournament so let's get you started! 

First you will want to Edit your deck. There you can add cards to your deck so you can use them to crush your opponents! Simply click the card and click the button to add it to your deck. We have already given you a starter pack. It contains an Addition and Subtraction card. These cards are good starters but won't be that effective against the more difficult enemies. Remember, you can only have up to 3 cards in your deck at a time!

After you finish your deck, start battling your opponents to move up the leaderboard and win new cards! Opponents will get harder with each new unlocked challenger, so make sure to use those harder cards to beat them.

Good luck getting that trophy kid!
